And many other features, the idea of the project was to be a hub for anything greyhack related, the project currently is in maintenance mode due to my lack of time to work on it, and because of poor cooperation with the greyhack offical dev team, thus i decided to stop making tools to support greyhack and started creating my own game to compete with greyhack.
